    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>In order to run this application please make sure you have downloaded all the files in the package.<br><br>
    The repository for this project can be found <a href ="https://github.com/jessithejinx/FinalYearProject"> here</a>

      This is a web application so will be run in your browser.<br><br> 
      I would recommend using Google Chrome version 57.0.2987.133 as the application is fully functional 
      in this browser and other browsers do not support some of the functionality that this app offers <br><br> 

      Additionally the file format must be that which is generated by using the ParseJ48.py program found in weka-json-parser-master
      Further instructions on how to convert your file can be found <a href="https://github.com/rudi-c/weka-json-parser">here.</a><br><br> 
      Please note that I neither own, nor created the ParseJ48.py script, it is used as a reformatting tool, credit for this goes to <a href="https://github.com/rudi-c">Rudi Chen</a><br><br> 

      Pre generated test files are available in the folder named "Test Files"
      Older files that were used during various phases of the applications development can also be found in this folder under 
      "Previous test files", however they will no longer work in the apps current state<br><br> 

      <b>To test this program:</b> 
      <ol>
      <li>Open index.html </li>
      <li>Click "choose file" and select the Weka text file "Weka-vote-reformatted.txt" from the Test files folder</li>
      <li>Click submit </li>
      <li>If you wish to download your file press the "Download as" button in the format you would like. </li>
